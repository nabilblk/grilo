# ![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png) Grilo - A Gitops Opinionated Framework

## Overview

Grilo was born to join the gitops mouvement and offer a piece that can help developers to boostrap complete k8s cluster focusing on enhancing the Dev and Ops Experience .

- Why another gitops Framework :
    - Many repetitive and boring tasks when boostraping a new cluster : install Istio , install monitoring stack , creating policies ...
    - No standard way to create a gitops repository .
    - Full Gitops from start to end when `real cluster = git state` can be a reality .
    - Collecting carrefully CNCF and some wonderfull OSS project can give world class experience and decorate your naked `k8s` cluster
    - We have an opinion 😂
